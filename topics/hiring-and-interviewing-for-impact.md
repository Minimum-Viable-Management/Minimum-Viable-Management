# 🎯 Hiring and Interviewing for Impact

Informed by Mike McQuaid’s post
[How and why I interview engineers for Workbrew](https://mikemcquaid.com/how-and-why-i-interview-engineers-for-workbrew/).

## 🔑 Key Points

- Interviews should mirror real work.
  Mike favours practical, synchronous exercises that reflect how the team actually collaborates.

- Optimise for signal quality over speed.
  A thoughtful hiring loop may take longer to prepare, but it generates clearer evidence about how candidates think and ship.

- Treat candidates like collaborators.
  Share context, expectations, and feedback promptly to build trust — even when the decision is a decline.

- Interviewing is two-way.
  Strong candidates evaluate you on transparency, quality of questions, and whether the process reflects the culture you claim to uphold.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Calibrate interview panels around explicit competencies (e.g. execution, collaboration, product intuition) and capture evidence for each.
2. Offer candidates an synchronous work sample that uses your real tools or a simplified version of your stack; debrief live to explore trade-offs.
3. Close every loop with actionable feedback and an invitation to stay in touch for future roles.
