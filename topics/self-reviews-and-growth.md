# 📓 Engineers’ Self-Reviews and Growth Plans

Based on Neha Batra’s LeadDev article
[An engineer’s self-review guide](https://leaddev.com/career-development/engineers-self-review-guide).

## 🔑 Key Points

- Treat the self-review as your narrative.
  Summaries of tickets or velocity metrics fall flat; focus on impact, lessons learned, and growth moments.

- Anchor achievements to business or team outcomes.
  Explain why the work mattered, not just what you shipped.

- Capture feedback you received and how you acted on it to demonstrate coachability.
- Identify 2–3 growth themes supported by concrete examples to guide next-cycle development plans.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Maintain a running brag document that logs impact anecdotes, feedback, and data throughout the review period.
2. Draft the review using the formula: **Context → Actions → Outcomes → Learnings**.
3. Close with the support you need—mentorship, resources, or stretch assignments—so your manager can respond with a plan.
