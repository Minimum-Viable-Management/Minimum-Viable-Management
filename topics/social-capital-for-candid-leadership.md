# 🧵 Social Capital for Candid Leadership

Drawn from Minimum Viable Management Episode 4 on balancing authenticity with workplace politics.

## 🔑 Key Points

- Earn candour by solving a partner’s problem before you deliver dissent so your “no” arrives on a foundation of shared wins.
- Take time to understand how you truly feel and why before speaking so authenticity lands as clarity instead of venting.
- Praise responsible challenges in public channels to normalise curiosity and reinforce that honesty should move discussions forward.
- Distinguish supportive openness from oversharing; remote interactions still need respectful boundaries and constructive intent.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Track the stakeholders you will need to push back on soon and log one tangible favour or solved issue for each before the hard conversation.
2. Draft tough feedback privately, rewrite it in plain language, and double check it explains motivation, stakes, and the help you can offer next.
3. Close challenging threads with thanks and a recap of what improved to reward healthy debate.
