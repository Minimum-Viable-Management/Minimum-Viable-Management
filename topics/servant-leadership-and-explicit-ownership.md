# 🤝 Servant Leadership and Explicit Ownership

Mike and Neha frame servant leadership as getting in the trenches without martyrdom.
It hinges on being clear about what you own, showing vulnerability, and taking the unglamorous work when it helps the team win.

## 🔑 Key Points

- Define your “interface”.
  Tell the team what you uniquely provide — representing them in leadership rooms, translating feedback, or absorbing tough conversations.

- Share credit quickly.
  Step out of the limelight once others can lead, and bring people into decision forums as soon as it’s effective.

- Model willingness to take on the boring or uncomfortable tasks.
  Volunteer for the tough conversation, the escalated meeting, or the cleanup work.

- Pair vulnerability with action.
  Admitting you do not know something, then facilitating the right debate, builds more trust than pretending to have all the answers.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Publish a short “How I manage” note outlining what reports can expect from you and what you expect from them.
2. During planning, scan for toil or relational work your role is best suited to absorb and take it.
3. When you make a call, state the risks you are accepting and how you will measure success so the team sees your ownership.
