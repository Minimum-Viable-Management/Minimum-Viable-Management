# 🤝 Negotiating Cross-Functional Trade-Offs

Healthy collaboration replaces flat refusals with explicit assumptions and trade-offs.

## 🔑 Key Points

- "No" becomes productive when you share the assumptions that make it true.
- Conditional language ("if", "when", "unless") turns conflict into options the team can negotiate.
- Scope, time, staffing, and quality are the primary levers for resolving disagreements.
- Stage rollouts and waitlists to align delivery pace with technical risk.
- Pre-factor improvements while you build to keep the codebase moving forward without stalling delivery.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Translate every refusal into a conditional statement tied to a specific assumption.
2. Offer a trade-off menu across scope, time, staffing, and quality before escalation.
3. Propose staged releases or limited customer cohorts to reduce risk.
4. Add pre-factor tasks in the area you are shipping to keep the path clean.
