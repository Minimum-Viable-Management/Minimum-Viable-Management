# ⚡ Creating and Keeping Momentum

Synthesised from Minimum Viable Management Episode 4 on building and sustaining momentum.

## 🔑 Key Points

- Establish clarity before speed by ensuring everyone understands the mission, next steps and what success looks like.
- Slice work into visible increments that ship within weeks so progress stays tangible and course corrections stay cheap.
- Treat process as temporary scaffolding by adding lightweight coordination only when needed and retiring it once habits stick.
- Preserve intentional slack so momentum survives surprises instead of collapsing under 100 percent utilisation.
- Say no to low-leverage asks and align on priorities to protect the team's ability to finish what matters.
  Ground this practice in Mike McQuaid’s essay [Saying no](https://mikemcquaid.com/saying-no/).

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Interview three teammates this week to confirm they share the same mission, next deliverable, and definition of success, then clarify gaps immediately.
2. Build a demo roadmap that surfaces the smallest releasable milestone every four to six weeks and track it publicly.
3. Review each coordination ritual monthly and retire anything the team now handles autonomously before introducing new process.
4. Reconcile commitments every Friday using the [Saying no](https://mikemcquaid.com/saying-no/) framework so you model boundaries and keep capacity for experimentation.
