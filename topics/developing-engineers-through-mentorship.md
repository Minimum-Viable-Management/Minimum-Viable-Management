## 🔑 Key Points

- Differentiate mentoring (guidance), coaching (skill-building), and sponsorship (advocacy) so engineers get the support they actually need.
- Treat mentorship as a product: assign owners, define success metrics, and iterate on the matching process.
- Prep both sides before pairing—set goals, cadence, confidentiality expectations, and exit criteria.
- Encourage mentees to drive the agenda while mentors bring perspective, networks, and accountability.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Build a lightweight intake form capturing mentorship goals, learning styles, and preferred communication modes.
2. Kick off pairings with a structured first meeting template that defines objectives, measures, and experiments to try.
3. Review mentorship matches quarterly; rotate or graduate pairs when goals are met to keep the program fresh.
