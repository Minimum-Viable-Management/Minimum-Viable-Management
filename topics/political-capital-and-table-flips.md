# 🪙 Political Capital and Table Flips

Political capital is a real workplace currency, and the most durable leaders choose when to spend it with intent.

## 🔑 Key Points

- Political capital exists in every workplace, and it grows more important as you move into leadership.
- Build it by giving more than you take so people trust your motives when you need to push.
- Spend it tactically on the few boulders worth moving because you cannot fight every battle.
- Use privilege or surplus capital to protect others, create accountability, and back promotions or questions.
- Map where political capital sits across managers, peers, and allies so you can choose the right messenger.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Map your current capital and your team's, noting who can open doors or ask hard questions safely.
2. Pick one high value outcome this quarter where spending capital will move the needle, then say no to lower value battles.
3. When you have surplus capital, sponsor someone else's promotion or ask a pointed question in a leadership forum.
4. If you are leaving, use your remaining capital to create accountability and recognition before it expires.
