# 🙋 Owning Mistakes Before Trust Erodes

Leaders keep credibility when they spot the early warning signs of failure, ask blunt questions about their own impact, and say sorry before frustration hardens into distrust.

## 🔑 Key Points

- Pay attention when work stalls, questions arrive without curiosity, or complaints come as accusations rather than hypotheses.
  Those signals show psychological safety is already low, so you must investigate what broke instead of waiting for a formal review.

- Ask directly how people feel and invite harsh answers, even if they sting.
  You cannot fix the environment while pretending the team is fine, and honesty from them demands humility from you.

- Separate blame from diagnosis.
  Model blameless retrospectives where people can say who may have triggered a problem while focusing the discussion on the system design that made the trigger dangerous.

- Remind teams that their worth is not tied to the output of their past work.
  Celebrate the fact they made the best call with the information they had, even if you now must reverse course.

- Put your own accountability on record.
  When you override or redirect the group, state that you will absorb responsibility for the outcome so they do not feel abandoned if the fix fails.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Open listening sessions by naming the awkward truth you see, then ask what feels broken and what people think you should stop doing.
2. After any outage or project cancellation, run a blameless retrospective that traces the chain of events and highlights missing guardrails instead of people to punish.
3. Follow every apology with an update on what you personally own next so the team sees you carrying part of the load.
