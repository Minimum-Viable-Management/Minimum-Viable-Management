# 💬 High-Trust Feedback for Senior ICs

At senior levels, feedback must be candid enough to feel “unfair”.
Mike and Neha describe how they pushed each other beyond conventional performance conversations to keep growth accelerating.

## 🔑 Key Points

- Raise the bar as scope grows.
  Principal-level engineers are evaluated on outcomes, not compliance with instructions; missing a result is still a miss even if the plan came from elsewhere.

- Deliver feedback quickly and with context.
  Call out what was inside someone’s control, what was not, and what you saw that prompted the rating or coaching.

- Build enough trust to explore “should have pushed back on me” moments.
  These conversations signal a relationship strong enough for real accountability on both sides.

- Normalise feedback hunger.
  Ask explicitly for improvement areas, even after stellar ratings, so people know critique is valued, not feared.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Capture feedback asynchronously but prioritise difficult debriefs for live conversations to preserve nuance.
2. For every major project, debrief on both outcome and process: what signals would we watch for next time, and where should we dissent earlier?
3. When giving ratings or performance signals, spell out how expectations shift at the next level so reports can self-assess the gap.
