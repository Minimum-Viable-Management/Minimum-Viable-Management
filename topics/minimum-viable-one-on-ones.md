# 🗣️ Minimum Viable One-on-Ones

Effective one-on-ones are the backbone of Mike’s “minimum viable management” checklist.
They work best when they are deliberate conversations, not weekly status recitals.
(See Mike’s [Minimum Viable Engineering Management](https://mikemcquaid.com/minimum-viable-engineering-management/) blog post for the broader framework.

## 🔑 Key Points

- Treat the meeting as a dialogue.
  Both sides should arrive with questions, context, and feedback to exchange rather than a soapbox monologue.

- Push low-friction updates into async channels.
  Daily progress or FYIs belong in tools like Geekbot stand-ups, Slack threads, or docs so the one-on-one can focus on higher-leverage topics.

- Use synchronous time for the hard stuff.
  Deliver challenging feedback, work through ambiguity, and surface blockers face to face (or at least cameras on) to preserve empathy and clarity.

- Make it a two-way feedback loop.
  Managers should explicitly invite critique on their own performance and processes to keep trust high.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Share a lightweight agenda document where both people can park questions through the week.
2. Start with context exchange: what has changed, what’s coming, and how company-level shifts might affect work.
3. Leave time at the end for mutual feedback: “What could I do differently next week?” or “What do you need to keep momentum?”
