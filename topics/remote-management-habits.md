# 🌍 Remote Management Habits

Derived from Mike McQuaid’s article [More effective remote working](https://mikemcquaid.com/more-effective-remote-working/).

## 🔑 Key Points

- Default to asynchronous by capturing decisions, context, and updates in writing first.
- Be intentional about synchronous time.
  Reserve meetings for high-bandwidth collaboration, feedback, or relationship building.

- Set and communicate working hour preferences, but stay responsive across time zones through clear expectations and documented processes.
- Continuously tweak tooling—automation, status bots, or shared dashboards—to reduce coordination overhead.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Maintain a team working-agreement doc that covers communication channels, response expectations, and meeting etiquette.
2. Use weekly written updates (e.g. Geekbot, Basecamp-style pings) to surface progress and flags without creating meeting sprawl.
3. Rotate meeting-friendly times to distribute inconvenience and pair them with recorded summaries for those who cannot attend.
