# ‚öñÔ∏è Accountability and Compromise in Leadership

Leadership means owning the fallout of imperfect decisions and embracing the compromises that come with shifting from individual contributor to manager.

## üîë Key Points

- Stay consistent after the call is made.
  Even if you disagreed, retell the facts accurately, share the rationale, and help the team move forward.

- Be mindful of your venting venues.
  Leaders have fewer safe spaces to process disappointment; choose peers or mentors, not public channels that restart uncertainty for everyone who reads them later.

- Make accountability explicit.
  If you override the team, tell them you will absorb the consequences.
  If you delegate, clarify the expectations and risks they are accepting.

- Accept the trade-offs of the role.
  Moving toward management often means writing less code, losing access to individual contributor (IC) exclusive spaces, and being evaluated on outcomes you cannot control alone.

- Focus on impact, not preference.
  When you are no longer the most technical person in the room, lean into connecting dots, building trust with other functions, and ensuring the right decisions emerge.

## üõ†Ô∏è Put It Into Practice

1. When a controversial decision lands, schedule a follow-up to align on messaging and support plans for the team.
2. Build a trusted peer group (inside or outside the company) where you can process decisions candidly without eroding confidence internally.
3. Audit your calendar quarterly: if your time is not matched to the highest-impact work for the organisation, rebalance toward influence over individual execution.
