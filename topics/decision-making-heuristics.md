# 🧠 Decision-Making Heuristics

Episode two dives into how Mike and Neha move decisions forward without sacrificing inclusion.
Their playbooks combine fast iteration with deliberate listening and clarity about who owns the call.

## 🔑 Key Points

- Start by sampling the room.
  Ask what others would do first; if their answers align with yours, you can move quickly while letting the team feel ownership.

- Time-box debate.
  When opinions diverge, gather the right experts, hear their perspectives, and decide when the clock runs out instead of letting the discussion sprawl.

- Confirm people felt heard.
  Before you decide, ask stakeholders if they believe their input was understood — even if the outcome differs.

- Separate expertise from consensus.
  Prioritise the voices who carry context or accountability for the work, then communicate the decision and rationale to everyone affected.

- Adjust for remote environments.
  Written channels amplify slow-burn debates; inject clarifying information as conversations unfold so teams avoid misaligned narratives.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Document the decision maker, decision drivers, consult list, and informed list (a lightweight DACI/RACI) before you convene a discussion.
2. Explicitly classify decisions as reversible or irreversible to match the amount of consensus-building effort you invest.
3. When announcing the outcome, pair the “what” with “why now” and “how we’ll revisit” so dissenters know the path forward.
