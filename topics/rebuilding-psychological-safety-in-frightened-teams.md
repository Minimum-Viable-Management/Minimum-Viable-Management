# 🛡️ Rebuilding Psychological Safety in Frightened Teams

Stabilise anxious teams by pairing transparent communication with consistent follow-through until trust returns.

## 🔑 Key Points

- Diagnose fear by watching for silence, lack of correction or disengagement in meetings and asynchronous channels.
- Anchor the team with predictable rituals, visible decision logs, and aligned words and actions so people relearn what to expect.
- Lead with service by fixing a few pain points yourself before asking for change, proving you are invested in their reality.
- Show your humanity in writing through values-led updates, open AMAs, and owning mistakes so empathy has room to grow.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Publish a weekly written update that spells out what you learned, decided, and will deliver next to link your words and actions.
2. Schedule listening one-on-ones focused on "what is making work feel unsafe?" and close the loop with explicit follow-up notes.
3. Pick one recurring friction point and co-deliver the fix with the team member most affected to model partnership.
