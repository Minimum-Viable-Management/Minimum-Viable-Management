# 🌐 Building Context and Connections

Managers amplify their teams by spotting the invisible organisational chart and brokering the right conversations before friction appears.

## 🔑 Key Points

- Track who influences outcomes today *and* who will matter as the organisation evolves.
  Help your reports build those relationships early.

- Share the “why” behind your suggestions.
  Explain impending changes, cross-team dependencies, or leadership priorities so the connection request lands.

- Remove yourself as the router.
  Give people enough background that they can resolve recurring issues directly the next time.

- Stay informed on behalf of your team.
  Lurk in relevant channels, docs, and meetings so you can answer “why is this happening?” with confidence.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Maintain a lightweight map of key partners, their goals, and current health of the relationship.
2. During one-on-ones, ask “Who else needs to know about this?” and “Who could unblock you faster than I can?”
3. When introducing two people, provide context, expectations, and any early shared wins to aim for.
