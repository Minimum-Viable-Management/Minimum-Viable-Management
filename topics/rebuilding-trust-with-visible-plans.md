# 📋 Rebuilding Trust with Visible Plans

Trust rebounds when leaders write down the recovery plan, share the names of the people who shaped it, and let those most affected help course-correct in public.

## 🔑 Key Points

- Write the plan where everyone can read it, whether that is a e.g. Google Doc, Slack thread, or Notion page.
  People assume you do not have a strategy if they cannot read it, and they will fill the silence with anxiety.

- Credit the voices you consulted.
  Naming contributors makes it obvious you did not design the fix alone and gives others a clear path to influence the next revision.

- Pair words with action without skipping the explanation.
  Announce what will change, then show the first win quickly so teams get both early clarity and proof you can execute.

- Re-reel the plan every week.
  Ask whether any bullet still applies, update it openly, and explain why you changed course so people see adaptability as listening rather than inconsistency.

- Pre-brief the people whose work is being changed and recruit them into the fix.
  Walk them through your reasoning, offer them a visible role in the transition, and show how their strengths fuel the future rather than erasing their past effort.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Publish a concise recovery plan that lists immediate actions, owners, and the date of the next update so nobody wonders when they will hear from you again.
2. Before announcement day, meet with anyone whose project will be majorly effected and ask how they want to stay involved in the new plan.
3. Review the plan with your team every week, highlighting what changed, what shipped, and what feedback you still need so people feel momentum rather than churn.
