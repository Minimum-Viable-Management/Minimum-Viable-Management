# 🎭 Intentional Authenticity at Work

Intentional authenticity means choosing how much of yourself to bring to work so you can sustain energy without losing integrity.

## 🔑 Key Points

- Full authenticity is not always safe or productive, so decide what percentage of yourself to bring.
- Clarify what you want from the job, then compare it to what the role can provide now to find the overlap.
- Use that overlap to guide where you invest effort, and direct the rest of your energy into life outside work.
- Relationships are a durable asset from every job, so protect and grow them even when you plan to leave.
- Treat work as a sandbox where small, calculated risks can reignite growth without reckless burnout.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Write two lists: what you want to gain, and what the role offers today, then circle the intersection.
2. Decide the portion of yourself you will bring to work and name what you will keep for life outside work.
3. Pick one experiment that stretches you and one boundary that protects you, then review both in a month.
4. Track relationships you want to keep after you leave and schedule time to invest in them.
