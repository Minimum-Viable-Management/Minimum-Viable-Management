# ⭐ Staff-Plus Engineering Expectations

Rooted in Mike McQuaid’s primer [What is a Staff+ / Principal engineer?](https://mikemcquaid.com/what-is-a-staff-plus-principal-engineer/).

## 🔑 Key Points

- Staff-plus engineers extend beyond code.
  They are force multipliers who shape technical strategy, influence cross-team outcomes, and mentor others.

- Impact is measured by durable business and organisational results, not volume of commits.
- The role requires proactive leadership: spotting misalignments early, proposing solutions, and driving consensus without formal authority.
- Success hinges on communication—narrating trade-offs, building trust with leadership, and translating strategy for the team.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Co-create charters with your Staff+ partners that spell out expectations, decision scopes, and collaboration rituals.
2. Include Staff+ engineers in roadmap shaping and postmortem reviews to benefit from their systems perspective.
3. Evaluate their performance through narratives of influence: what changed because they were involved?
