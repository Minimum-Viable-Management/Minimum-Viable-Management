# 📐 Scoping and Estimation Pitfalls

Summarized from Mike McQuaid’s article
[Hidden complexities of software estimation](https://mikemcquaid.com/hidden-complexities-of-software-estimation/).

## 🔑 Key Points

- Estimates fail when we ignore unknowns.
  Every project contains ambiguous work that needs explicit risk buffers.

- Complexity hides in integrations, migrations, and dependencies on other teams; surface these early to reduce surprises.
- Track estimate accuracy over time to improve forecasting.
  Retrospectives should include “what did we miss?” as a standing question.

- Communicate uncertainty openly.
  Stakeholders prefer ranges with assumptions to false precision.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Break initiatives into “known knowns,” “known unknowns,” and “assumptions to validate” before committing dates.
2. Consider a risks with probability, impact, owner, and mitigation for each meaningful one.
3. Compare planned vs. actual effort at project close-out and share lessons for iterative improvement.
