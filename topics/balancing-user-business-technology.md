# ⚖️ Balancing User, Business, and Technology

Healthy cross-functional work keeps user needs, business outcomes, and technical sustainability in balance.

## 🔑 Key Points

- Design, product, and engineering each represent a persona, but decisions improve when all three are voiced together.
- Tension is healthy when it surfaces trade-offs without trying to win outright.
- Bring revenue, customer impact, and roadmap sequencing data into the conversation so priorities are visible.
- Respect the work you are not doing, because each role carries load you do not want to own.
- Guard against over-optimising for any one persona so the organisation does not tip over.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Map the user, business, and technology personas for major requests.
2. Consider which persona may be under-served before final decisions are made.
3. Track trade-offs so disagreements stay grounded in priorities.
4. Document decisions and revisit them when new information arrives.
