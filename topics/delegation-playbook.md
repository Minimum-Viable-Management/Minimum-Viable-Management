## 🔑 Key Points

- Inventory your responsibilities across four quadrants: tasks only you can do, things to share, stretch opportunities, and work to drop entirely.
- Delegate outcomes, not tasks.
  Clarify the “why,” success criteria, guardrails, and check-in cadence instead of prescribing step-by-step execution.

- Match opportunities to growth goals.
  Pair stretch work with explicit support and safety nets so it accelerates development instead of triggering burnout.

- Build trust before you hand things off.
  Delegation fails when psychological safety is missing or when expectations shift mid-flight.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Run a quarterly responsibility audit and pick two items to delegate or sunset.
2. Use a delegation brief: context, desired outcome, constraints, stakeholders, and decision authority.
3. Maintain a shared tracker of delegated work with agreed milestones to avoid “drive-by” check-ins.
