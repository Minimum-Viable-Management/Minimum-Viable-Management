# 🛑 Setting Boundaries and Saying No

Grounded in Mike McQuaid’s essay [Saying no](https://mikemcquaid.com/saying-no/).

## 🔑 Key Points

- Every “yes” consumes limited focus.
  Leaders must deliberately protect bandwidth for high-leverage work.

- Saying no is easier when you articulate priorities.
  Share the trade-offs you’re making so stakeholders understand the reasoning.

- Offer alternatives where possible: defer, delegate, or suggest a lighter-weight experiment instead of an outright rejection.

- Model boundaries publicly — decline meetings, batch communication, and pause work when context shifts—to normalise healthy practices.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Review your commitments weekly and reconsider anything that no longer supports this quarter’s goals.
2. Adopt a response template: **Acknowledge → Explain priority conflict → Suggest next step**.
3. Revisit “nos” alongside “yeses” when priorities or capacity change.
