# 🛑 Setting Boundaries and Saying No

Grounded in Mike McQuaid’s essay [Saying no](https://mikemcquaid.com/saying-no/).

## 🔑 Key Points

- Every “yes” consumes limited focus.
  Leaders must deliberately protect bandwidth for high-leverage work.

- Saying no is easier when you articulate priorities.
  Share the trade-offs you’re making so stakeholders understand the reasoning.

- Replace a flat "no" with conditions and assumptions so partners can help you reach a viable yes.

- Offer alternatives where possible: defer, delegate, or suggest a lighter-weight experiment instead of an outright rejection.

- Model boundaries publicly — decline meetings, batch communication, and pause work when context shifts—to normalise healthy practices.

- Build social capital ahead of tough refusals by helping partners succeed so future boundaries land with trust.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Review your commitments weekly and reconsider anything that no longer supports this quarter’s goals.
2. Adopt a response template: **Acknowledge → Explain priority conflict → Suggest next step**.
3. Revisit “nos” alongside “yeses” when priorities or capacity change.
4. Pair every hard no with one proactive yes you can deliver soon to reinforce partnership.
5. Use "if", "when", or "unless" to define the trade-off you need on scope, time, staffing, or quality.
