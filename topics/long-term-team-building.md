## 🔑 Key Points

- Commit to multi-year visioning.
  Share where the team is heading, how roles might evolve, and how today’s work contributes.

- Invest in rituals that compound: recurring demos, cross-team pairing, and lightweight succession planning build resilience.
- Track load-bearing teammates and distribute context so no single person becomes a long-term bottleneck.
- Balance stability with renewal.
  Preserve the core mission while cycling in new challenges, skills, and perspectives.

## 🛠️ Put It Into Practice

1. Maintain a living team charter covering mission, tenets, operating principles, and interfaces.
2. Rotate ownership of key ceremonies (planning, demos, postmortems) to broaden influence and avoid single points of failure.
3. Pair annual planning with “stay interviews” to understand what keeps high performers motivated.
